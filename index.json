It is a bit tricky when we want to use Ubuntu for development on the same machine. We have 3 options: Buy a new HDD/SSD for Ubuntu and replace the Windows drive. Buy a new HDD/SSD for Ubuntu connect the drive in different SATA/NVME slot, if your machine can support more than 1 drive. Install Ubuntu on the same physical drive with Windows OS. If your plan is first option, you can skip to section 2.2. If you plan is second or third option, you are making your Ubuntu Dual-Boot in your machine. Please follow the note below. For Dual Boot: Ubuntu on separated drive Physically disconnect all drives in your machine before you proceed with installation, except the SSD/HDD you wish to install Ubuntu. This is to make sure the Ubuntu GRUB (boot loader) is installed in the same drive with Ubuntu OS. For Dual Boot: Windows-Ubuntu on single drive Assumed you have typical Windows setup, main OS installed on C: volume and D: volume as storage. You may shrink either C: or D: volums depending on your use case. Use Windows’s Disk Management to re-structure disk volume: Press Windows key + x and select Disk Management from the list. Right click the volume you wish to shrink and select Shrink Volume. Enter the amount of space and click Shrink to execute. Now you can see a new unused volume beside the volume you have shrinked. Next step is to install Ubuntu OS on the volume.
